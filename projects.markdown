## Projects


[**Stability of Evolutionary Population Games**](https://github.com/synkathairo/evolutionary_game_strategies) (Oct 2024 - Dec 2024)
- Examined population games and evolutionary games using a game theoretic framework
- Focused on stabilities of Nash equilibria and evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) under pure and mixed-strategies using probability models, non-equilibrium behavior within bounds, asymptotic stability, and numerical simulation of games
- Game theoretic optimization
- Studied dynamics of population games, such as evolutionary games, games under pure and mixed-strategies, and used probability models
- Examined various mean dynamics (modeled by ordinary differential equations), evolutionarily stable strategies, Nash equilibria, equilibrium stabilities (e.g. Lyapunov stability), non-equilibrium behavior within bounds, asymptotic stability, and numerical simulation of games

**Comparison of Cortisol Secretion in Overweight and Healthy Weight Females** (Sept 2024 - Dec 2024)
- Utilized a state-space model of cortisol secretion using tissue-based collection analysis, modeling adrenal, serum, and tissue diffusion of cortisol, under hypothesis of cortisol secretion as a point process
- Used deconvolution and sparse recovery signal processing methods to estimate incidence of cortisol secretion events
- Compared circadian and ultradian cortisol secretion patterns between overweight and healthy weight female patient cohorts, to demonstrate differences in hormone dynamics between the two groups

**Morris Decay, Optimality of approximate counting algorithms with ε decay** (Oct 2023 — Dec 2023)
- Algorithmic analysis and uncertainty quantification
- Studied the well-known approximate counter algorithm of Morris, and the improved Morris+ algorithm
- Developed complexity analysis and characterized approximation bound and space complexity
- Suggested an improved algorithm to further reduce error range in scenarios of high counts

**Miscellanea**
- [geodesic-optimization](https://github.com/synkathairo/geodesic-optimization) - implementation of geodesic optimization methods in Julia. These methods generalize convex optimization for non-Euclidean problems.
- [synkathairo.github.io](https://github.com/synkathairo/synkathairo.github.io) - this very webpage
- [Youtube_playlist-no_login](https://github.com/synkathairo/Youtube_playlist-no_login) - a basic Chrome extension, conforming to the WebExtension API
- [flan-t5-large-gradio](https://github.com/synkathairo/flan-t5-large-gradio) - a frontend using the [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) library to interact with [Google's Flan-T5 Large](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large) language model, using a chat-like interface.
- [Ruebook](https://github.com/synkathairo/ruebook) - a web application built for BostonHacks 2021 using Node.js, Bootstrap, and Express, utilizing the Google Cloud Natural Language API. Analyzes user sentiments in journal entries and particular themes which cause users stress.
- [rsa-py](https://github.com/synkathairo/rsa-py) - proof-of-concept implementation in Python of the [Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\(cryptosystem\)) encryption algorithm.
- [Watchers-app](https://github.com/watchers-cs673/Watchers-app) - a social media web app project which allows sharing of posts about favorite movies, providing an interactive and collaborative platform for movie lovers. Course project. Uses Angular, Express, and Prisma ORM.
- [embedded-gyrometer](https://github.com/synkathairo/embedded-gyrometer) - gyroscope device using the STM32F429 Discovery Board (ARM-based) and associated L3GD20 gyroscope. Focus on estimation of stride length and step estimation using limited interface resources. Course project. Uses C, C++, and MbedOS.
