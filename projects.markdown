## Projects

[**Stability of Evolutionary Population Games**](https://github.com/synkathairo/evolutionary_game_strategies) (Oct 2024 - Dec 2024)
- Examined population games and evolutionary games using a game theoretic framework
- Focused on stabilities of Nash equilibria and evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) under pure and mixed-strategies using probability models, non-equilibrium behavior within bounds, asymptotic stability (e.g. Lyapunov stability), and numerical simulation of games

**Comparison of Cortisol Secretion in Overweight and Healthy Weight Females** (Sept 2024 - Dec 2024)
- Utilized a state-space model of cortisol secretion using tissue-based collection analysis, modeling adrenal, serum, and tissue diffusion of cortisol, under hypothesis of cortisol secretion as a point process
- Used deconvolution and sparse recovery signal processing methods to estimate incidence of cortisol secretion events
- Compared circadian and ultradian cortisol secretion patterns between overweight and healthy weight female patient cohorts, to demonstrate differences in hormone dynamics between the two groups

**Miscellanea**
- [geodesic-optimization](https://github.com/synkathairo/geodesic-optimization) - implementation of geodesic optimization methods in Julia. These methods generalize convex optimization for non-Euclidean problems.
- [embedded-gyrometer](https://synkathairo.github.io/embedded-gyrometer/) - gyroscope device using the STM32F429 Discovery Board (ARM-based) and associated L3GD20 gyroscope. Focus on estimation of stride length and step estimation using limited interface resources. Course project. Uses C, C++, and MbedOS.
- [rsa-py](https://github.com/synkathairo/rsa-py) - proof-of-concept implementation in Python of the [Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) encryption algorithm.
- [synkathairo.github.io](https://github.com/synkathairo/synkathairo.github.io) - this very webpage
- [Watchers-app](https://github.com/watchers-cs673/Watchers-app) - a social media web app project which allows sharing of posts about favorite movies, providing an interactive and collaborative platform for movie lovers. Course project. Uses Angular, Express, and Prisma ORM.
- [Youtube_playlist-no_login](https://github.com/synkathairo/Youtube_playlist-no_login) - a basic Chrome extension, conforming to the WebExtension API
