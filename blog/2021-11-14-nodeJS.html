<h2>Experience using Node.js</h2>
<p><time datetime="14 Nov 2021">14 Nov 2021</time></p>
<p>While learning to use node.js along the way was more difficult than
expected, we did manage to produce a <a
href="https://github.com/synkathairo/ruebook">final product</a>! Overall
I would rate that a success! ٩(•̤̀ᵕ•̤́๑)ᵒᵏᵎᵎᵎᵎ</p>
<p>The focused environment of a hackathon as well as the collaborative
aspect means that it is more possible to create a product prototype
quickly; perhaps this is reminiscent of workplaces?</p>
