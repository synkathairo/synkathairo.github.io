While learning to use node.js along the way was more difficult than expected, we did manage to produce a [final product](https://github.com/synkathairo/ruebook)! Overall I would rate that a success! ٩(•̤̀ᵕ•̤́๑)ᵒᵏᵎᵎᵎᵎ

The focused environment of a hackathon as well as the collaborative aspect means that it is more possible to create a product prototype quickly; perhaps this is reminiscent of workplaces?
